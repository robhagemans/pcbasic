# pause/quiet standard streams
# ----------------------------
# previously we had a version that redirected c-level streams, thereby catching non-python output
# based on https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/redirecting-all-kinds-of-stdout-in-python/
# or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/977840/redirecting-fortran-called-via-f2py-output-in-python/978264#978264
# however, that method either:
# - closes stdout/stderr, as in the above link; which means that any cached reference
#   to sys.stderr or sys.stdout now refers to a closed file, and leads to an IOError if flushed.
# - or doesn't close stdout/stderr, in which case the windows version of python 3 keeps a handle
#   to the old stdout, whcih is now an invalid handle, leading to a WindowsError when flushed.
#   background here:
#   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52373180/python-on-windows-handle-invalid-when-redirecting-stdout-writing-to-file
#   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/902967/what-is-a-windows-handle/902969#902969
# it would be possible to set PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO and use the python2 code to deal with unicode output, but
# - at some point we'll want to get rid of all the python2 compatibility code
# - it would be duplicating the standard library's approach which has surely had more people looking at it
# i have tried to use close-stdout approach and fix all stale references, however new ones keep popping
# up e.g. in logging, unittest, curses. there are probably more, which means hard-to-debug future crashes
# the only reason to redirect c-level stream were:
# - pyaudio on alsa produces a lot of chatter on init which is annoying on a console interface
# - pygame prints a "banner" message to the console when imported, which is annoying especially when using another interface
# since:
# - the first is annoying but does not deface the screen during runtime
# - the second only occurs in a deprecated interface, and can be avoided in other interfaces by delaying module load until it's needed
# - the whole thing is a bit hacky and clearly likely to break in newer python versions
# - there are probably still crashes hidden away in some code paths
# all of this is an unreasonable maintenance load and it is better to go with the supported method
# of doing a "shallow" redirect by reassigning sys.std***.
