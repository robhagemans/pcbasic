PC-BASIC typefaces
------------------

This directory contains 8-bit typefaces in unifont .HEX format for use with PC-BASIC. They have been derived from the sources below.
In most cases, the only change has been to extract a subset and to encode them in the .HEX format. The resulting derivative work is
released under the same licensing terms as the original.

Below is a summary of the authors and licences of the fonts in this directory.
Please check the individual .HEX file for original licence terms.

These HEX files have been produced by me (Rob Hagemans)
based on a visual representation of the original typefaces.

It is my understanding that:  

- In the USA, such typefaces are not copyrightable.  
- In the UK, the 25-year term of copyright for these typefaces has expired.  

However, you should ensure that you have the right to copy and use these typefaces in your jurisdiction.  

Insofar as I have created a copyrightable work by encoding these typefaces into the
present files, to the extent possible under law, I waive all copyright
and related or neighbouring rights to that work under the
[Creative Commons Zero dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
