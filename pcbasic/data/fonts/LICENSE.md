PC-BASIC typefaces
------------------

This directory contains 8-bit typefaces in extended Unifont .HEX format for use with PC-BASIC. They have been derived from the sources below.
In most cases, the only change has been to extract a subset and to encode them in the .HEX format. The resulting derivative work is
released under the same licensing terms as the original.

Below is a summary of the authors and licences of the fonts in this directory.
Please check the individual .HEX file for original licence terms.

**default**: based on CPIDOS, UNI-VGA and GNU Unifont
licence: GNU GPL v2.0 or later  

**vga**: DOSBox

These HEX files have been produced by me (Rob Hagemans)
based on a visual representation of the original typefaces.

It is my understanding that:  

- In the USA, such typefaces are not copyrightable.  
- In the UK, the 25-year term of copyright for these typefaces has expired.  

However, you should ensure that you have the right to copy and use these typefaces in your jurisdiction.  

Insofar as I have created a copyrightable work by encoding these typefaces into the
present files, to the extent possible under law, I waive all copyright
and related or neighbouring rights to that work under the
[Creative Commons Zero dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
