        <h3 id="workenv">The working environment</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing you'll see when starting PC-BASIC is the working environment.
            Like GW-BASIC, but unlike practically all modern compilers and interpreters,
            PC-BASIC's working environment serves both as a development environment and as a
            canvas on which to execute BASIC commands directly. With a few exceptions,
            practically all commands that can be run in the working environment can be used
            in a program, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default PC-BASIC screen has 25 rows and 80 columns. The 25th row is used
            by PC-BASIC to show keyboard shortcuts,
            which means you can't use it to type on. In some video modes, there are only 40
            or 20 columns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Logical lines</em> exceed the width of the physical row: if you keep
            typing beyond the screen width, the text will
            wrap to the next line but PC-BASIC will still consider it part of the same line.
            A logical line can be at most 255 characters long; if you type more than 255
            characters, it will ignore the remainder. A line can also be wrapped by a
            line-feed, entered with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, PC-BASIC will attempt to execute the
            logical line on which the cursor is placed as a command. When the command is executed correctly,
            PC-BASIC will display the prompt <samp>Ok</samp>. If there is an error, it will
            display an error message followed by <samp>Ok</samp>.
            If the line starts with a number, it will be stored as a program line. No prompt is displayed.
        </p>

                In PC-BASIC, the <kbd>F12</kbd> key can be used to enter special keys that are not

            <p>
                The <kbd>F12</kbd> key can also be used in combination with the regular number
                keys and arrow keys to enter numbers from the numeric keypad.
                The <kbd>F12</kbd> combinations are not present in GW-BASIC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, as in GW-BASIC, the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key can be used to enter characters by their <a href="#cp437">code points</a> (ASCII values).
                This is done by pressing the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and typing the code point as a decimal value
                on the numeric keypad, then releasing the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.

                Unlike in GW-BASIC, you can copy and paste text to the clipboard.

            </p>
            <p>
                Operating the clipboard with the mouse works in the style of X11:

                is paste.

                    may open your operating system's help system. It may be possible to avoid

        <h3 id="programs">Programs and files</h3>
        <p>
            PC-BASIC can hold one BASIC program at a time in memory. To enter a program
            line, start with a <em>line number</em> and enter BASIC commands after that.
            The maximum length of a program line is 255 characters, including the line
            number and any spaces. The program line will not be immediately executed, but
            stored in the program. Program lines are sorted by line number, so that line
            <code>10</code> is executed before line <code>20</code>. All program
            lines must have a line number. Line numbers range from <code>0</code> to <code>65535</code> inclusive.
            It is not possible to enter a line number higher than <code>65529</code>, but these can
            exist in loaded programs.
            Within one program line, statements are separated by colons <code>:</code>.
        </p>
         <p>
             To run the program, type the command <code>RUN</code>. PC-BASIC will now
            execute all program lines in order inside the working environment. You cannot
            move the cursor around or enter commands while the program is running. If and
            when the program finishes, it will return control of the working environment to
            you. You can interrupt a program at any time by using one of the key
            combinations <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Break</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Scroll
            Lock</kbd>. The program will stop immediately, print a <samp>Break</samp>
            message and return control to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In GW-BASIC, you can <em>not</em> use  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt a running program.
            However, many modern keyboards do not have a <kbd>Break</kbd> or
            <kbd>Scroll Lock</kbd> key, which would make it impossible to interrupt
            a program that does not exit. Therefore, by default, PC-BASIC treats <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
            as if it were <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Break</kbd>. Set the <a href="#settings">option</a> <code><a href="#--ctrl-c-break">ctrl-c-break</a>=False</code>
            if you prefer the GW-BASIC style behaviour. When using the text-based or command-line interface,
            this option is ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            A program can be stored on a drive by using the <code><a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a></code> command, in one of three ways:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plain text, readable by any text editor: <code>SAVE "MYPROG",A</code></li>
            <li>Tokenised, taking up less storage space: <code>SAVE "MYPROG"</code></li>
            <li>Protected, which is an encrypted format:  <code>SAVE "MYPROG",P</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In all three cases, the program will be written to the current working
            directory with the name <code>MYPROG.BAS</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            PC-BASIC can read and write Protected files created by GW-BASIC. Unlike
            GW-BASIC, however, it does not disable accessing the unencrypted contents of the
            file. The encryption used by GW-BASIC has been broken many decades ago, so
            Protected mode offered little protection anyway; disallowing access is a small
            security hazard as it would allow someone to send you a program that you cannot
            inspect before running it. However, it is possible to disable access of
            protected files by enabling the option <code><a href="#--hide-protects">hide-protected</a></code>. </p> <p>You
            can read a program file into memory with <code><a href="#LOAD">LOAD</a> "MYPROG"</code>. This will
            erase the program currently in memory and replace it with the one read from the
            current working directory. To access files in a different directory, specify a path from the current
            directory. The path specification follows DOS conventions. The only valid path
            separator is the backslash <code>\</code>. For example, <code>LOAD "PROGRAMS\MYPROG"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can load or run a program immediately on starting PC-BASIC by using the
            <code><a href="#--load">load</a></code> or <code><a href="#--run">run</a></code> options.
            For example,
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            <b>pcbasic --run=MYPROG.BAS</b>
        </code>
        <p>
            The arguments to these options can be provided
            as PC-BASIC paths or as paths in the standard form for your operating
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
            PC-BASIC can be used to convert between the three program formats: either by loading the program and saving
            in your desired format, or from the command line using the <code><a href="#--convert">convert</a></code> option. To convert a
            tokenised or protected file to plain text you could use, for example:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            <b>pcbasic --convert=A PROGRAMP.BAS PROGRAMA.BAS</b>
        </code>

            <h4 id="mounting">Accessing your drives</h4>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC emulates DOS disk devices, which are referred to by drive letters such as <code>Z:</code>.
                One of the drive letters is the <em>current device</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>Windows</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, PC-BASIC disk devices will agree with Windows drive letters at the
                    start of the PC-BASIC session.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If PC-BASIC is started from the start menu shortcut, the current device will be
                    your <i>Documents</i> folder (or <i>My Documents</i> on some versions of Windows).
                    You can change this location by setting the shortcut's <i>Start In</i> folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If PC-BASIC is started from the command prompt, the current device will be set to
                    the current working directory of the command prompt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If PC-BASIC's current device or <i>Start In</i> folder is changed to a system folder such as <code>C:\Program Files\PC-BASIC</code>,
                    Windows will move files written there to <code>%LocalAppData%\VirtualStore</code> instead.
                    This is best avoided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that <em>PC-BASIC's DOS disk devices are not the same thing as Windows drive letters</em>.
                    The device <code>C:</code> on PC-BASIC is <em>not</em> always your Windows <code>C:</code> drive.
                    By default, Windows drive letters are mapped to PC-BASIC devices at the start
                    of the PC-BASIC session. However, if you use the <code><a href="#--mount">mount</a></code> option;
                    or if Windows drive letters change while PC-BASIC is running (through e.g. <code>net use</code> or
                    <i>Map Network Drive</i> operations), they will no longer agree.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On <strong>other systems</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, <code>Z:</code> will point to the current working directory from where PC-BASIC was started.
                    It will be the current device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If started from a menu or app package, this will usually be your home directory <code>&tilde;</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This current device is where files will be saved to and loaded from in BASIC if you do not specify another device.
                You can change the current device using the <code><a href="#--current-device">current-device</a></code>
                option in the <a href="#settings">configuration file or on the command prompt</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can map drives and other file system locations as PC-BASIC devices by
                using the <code><a href="#--mount">mount</a></code> option. For example,
                on Windows, the option
                <code class="block">
                    <b>mount=A:C:\Users\Me\BasicFloppy</b>
                </code>
                will make the folder <code>C:\Users\Me\BasicFloppy</code> available as PC-BASIC's <code>A:</code> device.
                On other platforms, an example mount option could look like
                <code class="block">
                    <b>mount=A:/home/me/BasicFloppy</b>
                </code>
                which would make the directory <code>/home/me/BasicFloppy</code> available as PC-BASIC's <code>A:</code> device.
            </p>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC uses <a href="#eightpointthree">DOS conventions</a> for filenames and paths.
                These are subtly different from Windows short filename
                conventions and not-so-subtly different from Unix conventions. This may lead
                to surprising effects in the presence of several files that match
                the same DOS name. To avoid such surprises, it's best to run PC-BASIC in a working
                directory of its own and use all-caps 8.3 format for all files.

            <h4 id="program-files">Compatible BASIC files</h4>
            <p>
                Many BASIC dialects use the same extension <code>.BAS</code>, but their files are not compatible.
                PC-BASIC runs GW-BASIC program files only. Some tips to recognise GW-BASIC programs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>GW-BASIC files stored as text are plain text files with line numbers.</li>
                <li>Tokenised files are binary files that start with magic byte <code>&amp;hFF</code>.</li>
                <li>Protected files are binary files that start with magic byte <code>&amp;hFE</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In particular, QBASIC files (which have no line numbers) and QuickBASIC files
                (magic byte <code>&amp;hFC</code>) will not run.
            </p>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC will accept both DOS and Unix newline conventions for programs
                stored as plain text.
                This behaviour is different from GW-BASIC, which only
                accepts text files with <code><i>CR LF</i></code> line endings.
                As a consequence, in exceptional cases where a program line is continued through <code><i>LF</i></code>
                correct GW-BASIC text files may not be loaded correctly.
                If you encounter such a case, use
                the <code><a href="#--soft-linefeed">soft-linefeed</a></code> option to enable GW-BASIC behaviour. If
                <code>soft-linefeed</code> is enabled, text files in standard Unix format
                (<code><i>LF</i></code> line endings, no end-of-file character) will fail to load, as they do in GW-BASIC.
                On Linux or Mac, use a utility such as
                <a href="http://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html"><code>unix2dos</code></a>
                to convert programs saved as text files before loading them. When saving as text,
                PC-BASIC always uses <code><i>CR LF</i></code> line endings and <code>&amp;h1A</code> at end-of-file.

            <h4 id="packages">Packages</h4>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC can run packaged programs. A package is simply a directory or zip archive.
                The directory or zipfile contents will be loaded as the current working
                directory. If a configuration file named <code>PCBASIC.INI</code> is present
                inside this directory, its settings are loaded; usually, one of those settings will be a
                <code><a href="#--run">run</a></code> argument linking to a BASIC program enclosed in the archive or directory.
                PC-BASIC will recognise zipfiles regardless of their extension.
                A suggested extension for PC-BASIC packages is <code>.BAZ</code>.
                Packages are a convenient choice if a program needs to change many PC-BASIC options
                to function as desired, or if it needs a particular working directory setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zipfile packages are unpacked to a temporary directory each time they are loaded.
                The temporary directory is removed when PC-BASIC closes. With zipfile packages, it is therefore
                not possible to save files and re-open them on the next run of the package.

            <h4 id="cassette">Cassette tapes</h4>
            <p>
                The <code>CAS1</code> device interfaces with the cassette tape emulator.
                Tapes were never very popular on the IBM PC, and indeed only available with the
                original PC and the PCjr. There are not many IBM PC cassettes in the wild.
                However, should you come across one, all you have to do to read it with PC-BASIC
                is record it into a <code>.WAV</code> (RIFF WAVE) file and attach it to the <code>CAS1:</code>
                device with the <code><b><a href="#--cas1">cas1</a>=WAV:</b><var>filename</var></code> option.
                You can also generate your own tape images and store your programs on it. <code>WAV</code>
                files generated by PC-BASIC are large but very easily compressed in a <code>ZIP</code>
                archive; this works better and leads to smaller files than transcoding to a lossy
                audio format like <code>MP3</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an alternative to <code>.WAV</code>, you can store tapes in <code>CAS</code>
                format. This is simply a bit-dump of the tape and is interchangeable
                with tape images for the <a href="http://www.hampa.ch/pce/">PCE</a> IBM PC emulator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previous versions of PC-BASIC included support for BASICODE cassettes; this has
                been discontinued in favour of a separate
                <a href="https://github.com/robhagemans/basicode">BASICODE decoder</a>.
                Use this decoder to convert the BASICODE program to PC-BASIC format
                before loading it into PC-BASIC.

            <p>PC-BASIC makes some default choices with basic security in mind, but does not
                sandbox its programs in any meaningful way. BASIC programs have more or less
                full access to your computer. You should treat them with the same caution as
                you would shell scripts or binaries. Therefore, do not run a program from the
                internet that you have not inspected first using <code><a href="#LIST">LIST</a></code> or
                <code class="block"><b>pcbasic <a href="#--convert">--convert</a>=A</b> <var>filename</var></code> on the <a href="#settings">command line</a>. You wouldn't just download
                an executable from the internet and run it either, right?</p>

        <h4 id="printing">Printing</h4>
            <p>
                You can print from PC-BASIC programs
                by accessing the <code>LPT1:</code> device. PC-BASIC will send the output to
                your operating system's default printer, unless you change the <code>lpt1=</code>
                option. To print through a printer named <code>MyPrinter</code>, set
                <code><b><a href="#--lpt1">lpt1</a>=PRINTER:MyPrinter</b></code>. You can also attach printers to the
                <code>LPT2:</code> and <code>LPT3:</code> devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                The output will be sent to the printer when one of the following happens:
                a file open to <code>LPT1:</code> is closed, a program terminates, or PC-BASIC is closed.
                If you prefer, you can instead send every page separately to the printer by setting
                <code>lpt1=PRINTER:MyPrinter:page</code>. You can even send every line separately, but
                this only makes sense on a tractor-fed printer (as was common in GW-BASIC's heyday).
            </p>

            <p>
                It's easy to print to a file instead of a printer:
                set <code><b><a href="#--lpt1">lpt1</a>=FILE:output.txt</b></code>
                to send all <code>LPT1:</code> printer output to the text file <code>output.txt</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The printing statements <code><a href="#LPRINT">LPRINT</a></code> and <code><a href="#LLIST">LLIST</a></code> always send
                their output to PC-BASIC's <code>LPT1:</code> device.
            </p>

            <p>
                The presentation of printed documents is left to your operating system: it
                will be the default presentation of text files. If you wist to change the way
                documents are printed, please refer to your OS's settings. On Windows, for example, text files
                are printed by <code>notepad.exe</code> and changing the default settings in that
                application will change the way PC-BASIC documents are printed. You will need to set a
                printer font that includes the characters you need to print. On Unix systems,
                PC-BASIC will use the <code>paps</code> utility if it is available; this will
                automatically select fonts that support the characters you need.

            <h4 id="ports">Serial and parallel ports</h4>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC provides the serial devices <code>COM1:</code> and <code>COM2:</code>.
                To make use of these, you need to attach them to a communications port on your
                computer with the <code><a href="#--com1">com1</a>=</code> or <code><a href="#--com2">com2</a>=</code> option. To attach to
                the first physical serial port, set <code><b><a href="#--com1">com1</a>=PORT:0</b></code> (or, alternatively,
                <code><b><a href="#--com1">com1</a>=PORT:COM1</b></code> on Windows or
                <code><b><a href="#--com1">com1</a>=PORT:/dev/ttyS0</b></code> on
                Linux). If you do not have a serial port, you can emulate one by sending the
                communications over a network socket: set <code><b><a href="#--com1">com1</a>=SOCKET:localhost:7000</b></code>
                and all <code>COM1:</code> traffic will be sent through socket <code>7000</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To access a parallel port, attach it to one of <code>LPT1:</code>, <code>LPT2:</code> or <code>LPT3:</code>.
                For example, set <code><b><a href="#--lpt2">lpt2</a>=PARPORT:0</b></code> to attach your computer's first
                parallel port to <code>LPT2:</code>.

            <p>
                By default, PC-BASIC emulates GW-BASIC on a system with VGA video capabilities.
                However, it can emulate several other setups, which differ from each other in
                terms of video and audio capacity, fonts, memory size, as well as available BASIC syntax.
                The easiest way to set the emulation target is by using a <code><a href="#--preset">preset</a></code> option.
                For example, run <code><b>pcbasic --preset=pcjr</b></code>.
                Other available emulation target presets are:

                <em>Presets</em> are groups of options that are defined in the default configuration

                file with the name of the new preset, followed by the options you want to apply. For example,
                if you define:

                </code>
                you can now run <code><b>pcbasic --preset=my_preset</b></code> to start an emulation of

                PC-BASIC aims for a very high level of compatibility with GW-BASIC. However,

                These features can be switched on using individual <a href="#options">command-line options</a>. The highest level of
                compatibility with GW-BASIC can be attained by setting

                which switches off all convenience and security features that cause differences with

            <h4 id="codepages">Codepages</h4>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC supports a large number of legacy codepages that were common at the
                time GW-BASIC was popular, including double-byte character set codepages used
                for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. You can select your codepage by using the
                <code><a href="#--codepage">codepage</a>=</code> option. For example, <code>codepage=936</code> selects
                the GBK codepage commonly used on the Chinese mainland. PC-BASIC will load and
                save all program files as if encoded in the codepage you select.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also possible to load and save programs in the nowadays common UTF-8
                standard format, by enabling the <code><a href="#--utf8">utf8</a></code> option. When
                <code>utf8</code> is enabled, plain-text program source will be saved and loaded in
                standard UTF-8 encoding. Please note that you will still need to select a
                codepage that provides all the Unicode characters that your program needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that PC-BASIC does not implement the following features relevant to some of these codepages:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt id="bidi">
                    Bidirectional text
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    All text is printed
                    left-to-right independent of the codepage selected. To write strings in a language that
                    is written right-to-left, the logical character sequence must be inverted so that
                    the order appears correct visually. While this is inconvenient, it is in line with the behaviour of GW-BASIC.
                    This affects code pages marked with <i>B</i> in the table.

                    PC-BASIC recognises single-byte code points (where each glyph shows on a single cell on the screen) and
                    double-byte code points (where a single glyph takes up two cells on the screen). Combining characters
                    (such as the combining diacritics of codepages <code>874</code> and <code>1258</code>) are therefore not
                    shown correctly: instead of being combined with their preceding base character as a single combined glyph,
                    such combinations will be shown as separate glyphs. Where available, alternative codepages with precomposed
                    characters will give better results. This affects code pages marked with <i>C</i> in the table.

            <p>
                The following codepages are available. PC-BASIC uses the Microsoft OEM codepage number where
                this is unambiguous. The code pages are expected to agree with Microsoft sources for the ranges
                <code>&amp;h80</code>&ndash;<code>&amp;hFF</code>. Ranges <code>&amp;h00</code>&ndash;<code>&amp;h1F</code>
                and <code>&amp;h7F</code> are implemented as the IBM Special Graphic Characters where some
                code page sources will list these as the corresponding control characters.
                For unofficial codepages and those with conflicting numbering, codepage
                names are used instead of numbers.

                fonts of the original IBM and Tandy adapters (which are in the public
                domain in a number of countries) have been included in PC-BASIC. These provide the most
                accurate emulation. However, the font ROMs only included a single code page &#8211;
                DOS Latin USA 437.
            </p>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC defaults to a font which is very similar in style to the IBM VGA
                font but has support for many more code pages, in particular Western and Middle
                Eastern alphabets. Chinese, Japanese and Korean are supported through "fullwidth"
                glyphs which take the space of two regular characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to change the choice of font using the <code><a href="#--font">font=</a></code> option.
                You can provide a list of fonts, where the last font specified is the
                most preferred one.
            </p>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC reads fonts in a variant of the <code>.hex</code> format introduced by UniFont. It's
                easy to define custom fonts in this format: it can be edited in a regular text editor.
                See the UniFont project for an authoring tool. You can add custom fonts to PC-BASIC by
                installing them into the <code>font/</code> subdirectory of PC-BASIC's installation
                directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, the following fonts
                are available:

                If not all glyphs are found in the specified font(s), the <code>default</code>
                font is used as a fallback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The font names <code>freedos</code>, <code>univga</code>, and <code>unifont</code>
                are treated as synonyms of <code>default</code> unless a font with one of these names
                is available. This behaviour is deprecated.

        <h4 id="redirecting">Redirecting I/O</h4>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC supports redirecting input and output the GW-BASIC way: output redirected
                with the <code><a href="#--output">output</a>=</code> option will be sent to the screen as well as
                the specified file, while input redirected with <code><a href="#--input">input=</a></code> is taken
                only from the specified file. Note that screen output through the
                <code>SCRN:</code> device and keyboard input through the <code>KYBD:</code>
                device are not redirected. Files are read and written in the codepage set with
                PC-BASIC.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that it is also possible to use your operating system's facility to
                redirect console output using the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
                operators. It's best to set <code><b><a href="#--interface">interface</a>=none</b></code> so that I/O is
                redirected through the console. This will produce files in your console's standard encoding,
                which is often UTF-8 on Unix and Windows-1252 on Windows.

            <h4 id="cli">Command-line interface</h4>
            <p>
                You can run PC-BASIC as a
                command-line interface by setting the <code><a href="#--interface">interface</a>=cli</code> (or
                <code><a href="#-b">-b</a></code>) option. No window will be opened: you can type BASIC commands
                straight into your Command Prompt/Terminal. Use the horizontal arrow keys to
                move on the current line you're editing; use the vertical arrow keys to show
                screen rows above and below. Copy and paste are available only if the calling
                shell provides them. On Windows, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Break</kbd> will
                terminate PC-BASIC immediately. You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
                interrupt the program. The end-of-file key combination
                (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> on Unix, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> on Windows)
                will exit PC-BASIC.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use the command-line interface to run one or a few BASIC commands directly, like so:
            </p>
            <samp class="block">
                me@mybox$ <b>pcbasic -c '?1+1'</b><br />
                <b>&nbsp;2</b><br />
                me@mybox$
            </samp>
            <p>
                For scripting purposes, it is also possible to run PC-BASIC without any
                interface by setting <code><a href="#--interface">interface</a>=none</code> or
                <code><a href="#-n">-n</a></code>. If this is
                set, PC-BASIC will take input from and send output to the console as UTF-8
                without further modification. This is useful in combination with redirection and
                pipes.

            <h4 id="curses">Text-based interface</h4>
            <p>
                There is also a full-screen text interface available: enable it
                by setting <code><a href="#--interface">interface</a>=text</code> (or <code><a href="#-t">-t</a></code>). The text-based
                interface is very similar to the default graphical interface, but runs in your
                Command Prompt or Terminal window.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graphical screen modes can be used in text and command-line interface,
                but only the text on the screen will be visible.
                pre, many <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>
                key combinations are not available.
            </p>
            <p>
                The text and command-line interfaces will attempt to use the PC speaker
                for sound. Only single-voice sound can be produced this way.
                On Linux systems under X11, you may need to install the <code>beep</code> utility and
                enable the PC-speaker driver or emulation; direct speaker access is often
                limited to root or tty logins, and on Ubuntu systems it is disabled by default.
