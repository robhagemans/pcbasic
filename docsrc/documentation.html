<h1>PC-BASIC documentation</h1>

<p>PC-BASIC is a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC,
BASICA, PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GW-BASIC. It interprets
the BASIC dialects with a high degree of accuracy, aiming for
bug-for-bug compatibility. PC-BASIC also emulates the most common
video and audio hardware supported by these BASIC dialects in their
time.</p>

<h2>The working environment</h2>
<p>The first thing you'll see when starting PC-BASIC is the working environment. 
Like GW-BASIC, but unlike practically all modern compilers and interpreters, 
PC-BASIC's working environment serves both as a development environment and as a 
canvas on which to execute BASIC commands directly. With a few exceptions, 
practically all commands that can be run in the working environment can be used 
in a program, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The default PC-BASIC screen has 25 rows and 80 columns. The 25th row is used
by PC-BASIC to show keyboard shortcuts &ndash; more about those later &ndash; 
which means you can't use it to type on. In some video modes, there are only 40 
or even only 20 columns.</p>

<p><em>Logical lines</em> exceed the width of the physical row: if you keep 
typing beyond the screen width, the text will 
wrap to the next line but PC-BASIC will still consider it part of the same line.
A logical line can be at most 255 characters long; if you type more than 255 
characters, it will ignore the remainder. A line can also be wrapped by a 
line-feed, entered with <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Enter</b></code>.</p>

<p>If you press <code><b>Enter</b></code>, PC-BASIC will attempt to execute the
logical line on which the cursor is placed as a command. When the command is executed correctly, PC-BASIC will display the prompt <code>Ok</code>. If there is an error, it will display an error message followed by <code>Ok</code>.
If the line starts with a number, it will be stored as a program line. No prompt is displayed.</p>

The following keys have a special effect in the working environment:
<table>
<tr>
<td><code><b>&#8593;<!--up--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>6</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor up, except at the top row.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>&#8595;<!--down--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>-</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor down, except at row 24.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>&#8592;<!--left--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>]</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor left. The left edge of the screen wraps around, except at the top row.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>&#8594;<!--right--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>/</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor right. The right edge of the screen wraps around, except at row 24.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>&#8592;<!--left--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>B</b></code></td>
<td>Move to the first letter of the previous word. Words consist of letters A-Z and figures 0-9.</b>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>&#8594;<!--right--></b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>F</b></code></td>
<td>Move to the first letter of the next word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Tab</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>I</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor to the next tab stop. Tab stops are 8 columns wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Backspace</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>H</b></code></td>
<td>Delete the character left of the cursor, shift all further characters on the logical line one 
position to the left and change the attributes of those characters to the current attribute. At the 
left edge of the screen, this does the same as <code><b>Del</b></code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Del</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Backspace</b></code></td>
<td>Delete the character at the cursor and shift all 
further characters one position to the left, 
changing attributes to current.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Esc</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>[</b></code></td>
<td>Delete the current logical line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>End</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>E</b></code></td>
<td>Delete all characters from the cursor to the end 
of the logical line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Break</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>C</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Scroll Lock</b></code></td>
<td>Jump to the first column of the next line, without executing or storing the line under the cursor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Enter</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>M</b></code></td>
<td>Execute or store the current logical line. The 
complete line on the screen is considered part of 
the command, even if you did not type it.
A line starting with a number is stored as a 
program line.</td>
</tr>
<td><code><b>End</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>N</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor to the first position after the 
end of the logical line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Home</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>K</b></code></td>
<td>Move the cursor to the top left of the screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<code><b>Home</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>L</b></code></td>
<td>Clear the screen and move the cursor to the top 
left of the screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<code><b>Enter</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>J</b></code></td>
<td>Move to the first column of the next line, 
connecting the two lines into one logical line.</td>
<td><b>Ctrl</b>+<code><b>G</b></code></td>
<td>Beep the speaker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Pause</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Num Lock</b></code></td>
<td>Pause. Press another key to resume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Prt Sc</b></code></td>
<td>Toggle echoing screen output to the printer (or other device attached to <code>LPT1:</code>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Shift</b>+<b>Prt Sc</b></code></td>
<td>Print the screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><b>Ins</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>R</b></code></td>
<td>Toggle <em>insert mode</em>. In insert mode, characters  
are inserted rather than overwritten at the 
current location. If insertion causes the line to 
extend the physical screen width, the logical 
line extends onto the next line. Arrow keys exit 
insert mode.</td>

<h2>Changing settings</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC has a number of settings that change the way it operates. There are 
two ways to change these settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command-line options</dt>
<dd>You can enter command-line options if you start PC-BASIC from the console (the <em>Command Prompt</em> or <em>PowerShell</em> in Windows, or a <em>Terminal</em> in Unix), by preceding the name of the option with two dashes, like so:<br />
<pre>pcbasic --preset=tandy --ctrl-c-break=True
</pre>
On the command line, you can leave out the expression <code>=True</code> that is common in switching options.
Some options have an alternative, short name consisting of a single letter preceded by a single dash, which you can use on the command line. You can combine multiple short options with a single dash.</dd>
<dt>Configuration files</dt>
<dd>You can change options by adding or removing lines in your private configuration file. 
This configuration file is a file named <code>PCBASIC.INI</code> stored in your 
Application Data folder. The location of this folder is as follows:
<table>
<tr><th>OS</th><th>Configuration file location</th></tr>
<tr><td>Windows XP</td><td><code>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your username</em>\Application Data\pcbasic</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Windows 7</td><td><code>C:\Users\<em>your username</em>\AppData\Roaming\pcbasic</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>OS X</td><td><code>~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Linux</td><td><code>~/.config/pcbasic</code></td></tr>  
</table>
Change an option in the configuration file by adding a line in the section named <code>[pcbasic]</code>, like so:<br />
<pre>preset=tandy
ctrl-c-break=True
</pre>
You cannot use the sort name of options in the configuration file. You can also not leave out the expression <code>=True</code>.
</dd>
</ol>
<p>In either method, the options have the same name and syntax. In what follows, we will often refer to 
a particular option setting; remember that you can always set this from the command line as well as from the configuration file.</p>
</dl>
** add ref to USAGE file with full list of options **

<h2>BASIC programs</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC can hold one BASIC program at a time in memory. To enter a program line, start with a <em>line number</em> and enter BASIC commands after that. The maximum length of a program line is 255 characters, including the line number and any spaces. The program line will not be immediately executed, but stored in the program. Program lines are sorted by line number, so that line <code>10</code> is executed before line <code>20</code>.
To run the program, type the command <code>RUN</code> (without a line number). PC-BASIC will now execute all program lines in order inside the working environment. You cannot move the cursor around or enter commands while the program is running. If and when the program finishes, it will return control of the working environment to you. You can interrupt a program at any time by using one of the key combinations <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Break</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Scroll Lock</b></code>. The program will stop immediately, print a <code>Break</code> message and return control to you.</p>

<p>Normally, you can <em>not</em> use  <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>C</b></code> to interrupt a running program. However, some keyboards do not have a <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Break</b></code> or <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Scroll Lock</b></code> key, which would make it impossible to interrupt a program that does not exit. If you have such a system, you can enable the <code>ctrl-c-break</code> option. This is enabled by default on OS X systems as well as when using the text-based or command-line interface.
</p>

<p>A program can be stored on a drive by using the <code>SAVE</code> command, in one of three ways:
<ol>
<li>ASCII text, readable by a text editor: <code>SAVE "MYPROG",A</code></li>
<li>Bytecode, taking up less storage space: <code>SAVE "MYPROG"</code></li>
<li>Protected, which is an encrypted format:  <code>SAVE "MYPROG",P</code></li>
</ol>
In all three cases, the program will be written to the current working directory with the name <code>PROGRAM.BAS</code>.</p>

<p>PC-BASIC can read and write Protected files created by GW-BASIC. Unlike GW-BASIC, however, it does not disable accessing the unencrypted contents of the file. The encryption used by GW-BASIC has been broken many decades ago, so Protected mode offered little protection anyway; disallowing access is a small security hazard as it would allow someone to send you a program that you cannot inspect before running it. However, it is possible to disable access of protected files by enabling the option <code>strict-protect</code>.
</p>
You can read a program file into memory with <code>LOAD "MYPROG"</code>. This will erase the program currently in memory and replace it with the one read from the current working directory.
To access files in a different directory, specify a path from the current 
directory. The path specification follows DOS conventions. The only valid path 
separator is the backslash <code>\</code>. For example, <code>LOAD "PROGRAMS\MYPROG"</code>.
</p>

<p>You can load or run a program immediately on starting PC-BASIC by using the <code>load</code> or <code>run</code> options.
For example,
<pre>pcbasic --run=MYPROG.BAS
</pre>
The arguments to these options can be provided 
as PC-BASIC paths or as paths in the standard form for your operating 
system.</p>

<p>PC-BASIC can be used to convert between the three program formats: either by loading the program and saving 
in your desired format, or from the command line using the <code>convert</code> option. To convert a 
bytecode or protected file to ASCII you could use, for example:
<pre>pcbasic --convert=A PROGRAMP.BAS PROGRAMA.BAS
</pre>
</p>



<h3>A note on file names</h3>
<p>PC-BASIC follows DOS file system conventions, where file and directory names consist of a 
8-character name and 3-character extension. Names are case insensitive.
Note that DOS conventions are subtly different from Windows short filename 
conventions and not-so-subtly different from Unix conventions. This may lead
to surprising effects in the presence of several files that match 
the same DOS name. To avoid such surprises, run PC-BASIC in a working 
directory of its own and limit file names to all-caps 8.3 format.</p>

<p>When opening a data file, PC-BASIC will first look for a file with the name 
exactly as provided. This can be a long name and will be case sensitive if
your file system is. If such a file is not found, it will truncate the name
provided to 8.3 format and convert to all uppercase. If that exact name is
not found, it will look for 8.3 names in mixed case which match the name
provided in a case-insensitive way. Such files are searched in lexicographic
order. Files names longer than 8.3 will ot be matched, unless their name is entered exactly. 
On Windows, the name matched can be a short filename as well as a 
long filename provided it is of 8.3 length &mdash; it may, for example, contain 
spaces and thus not be a valid Windows short file name.</p>

<p>When loading or saving a program file, no attempt is made to find an exact 
match. Instead, the search will first match the all-caps 8.3 version of the
name and continue in lexicographic order as above. If no extension is 
specified, the extension .BAS will be implicitly added. To load a program
with no extension, end the filename in a dot. On file systems without
short filenames, it is not possible to load a program if its filename is 
longer than 8.3 or ends in a dot.</p>

<h3>Accessing your drives</h3>
<p>By default, drive letter <code>Z:</code> is mapped to the current working directory and 
is the current drive. In particular, it is not mapped to the Windows <code>Z:</code> 
drive, if that exists. You can map drives and other file system locations as PC-BASIC drive letters by
using the <code>mount</code> option. For example, 
<pre>pcbasic --mount=A:C:\Users\Me\BasicFloppy,C:C:\Users\Me\Stuff
</pre> or, on Unix,
<pre>pcbasic --mount=A:/home/me/BasicFloppy,C:/home/me/Stuff
</pre>
will map those locations to the PC-BASIC <code>A:</code> and <code>C:</code> drives.<p>

<p>If you want PC-BASIC's drive letters to be the same as those in Windows, enable the option <code>map-drives</code>. Use this with caution, since it means that your programs can now read and write on all drives that Windows allows you access to. On non-Windows systems, <code>map-drives</code> will map <code>C:</code> to your file system root, <code>H:</code> to your home directory and <code>Z:</code> to your current working directory.</p>


<h3>A note on BASIC files</h3>
<p>Many BASIC dialects use the same extension <code>.BAS</code>, but their files are not compatible. 
PC-BASIC runs GW-BASIC program files only. Some tips to recognise GW-BASIC programs:  
<ul>
<li>GW-BASIC files stored as ASCII are plain text files with line numbers.</li>
<li>Bytecode files are binary files that start with magic byte <code>FF</code>.</li>
<li>Protected files are binary files that start with magic byte <code>FE</code>.</li>
</ul>
In particular, QBASIC files (which have no line numbers) and QuickBASIC files (magic byte <code>FC</code>) will not run.</p>

<p>PC-BASIC will accept both DOS and Unix newline conventions for programs stored as ASCII text. This behaviour is different from GW-BASIC, which only accepts text files in DOS format: <code>CR/LF</code> line endings, <code>^Z</code> (character 26) at end-of-file. In some exceptional cases, correct GW-BASIC ASCII files may not be loaded correctly: for example, if they contain LF characters followed by a number. If you encounter such a case, use the <code>strict-newline</code> option to enable GW-BASIC behaviour.
If <code>strict-newline</code> is enabled, ASCII files in standard Unix format (<code>LF</code> line endings, no end-of-file character) will fail to load. On Linux or Mac, use a utility such as <a href="http://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html"><code>unix2dos</code></a> to convert programs saved as text files before loading them. When saving as ASCII, PC-BASIC always uses the DOS conventions.
</p>


<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC can run packaged programs. A package is simply a zip archive
that contains (at least) a configuration file named <code>PCBASIC.INI</code>. Settings
from the config file are loaded; usually, one of those settings will be a 
run= argument linking to a BASIC program enclosed in the zip archive.
PC-BASIC will recognise packages regardless of their extension.
A suggested extension for PC-BASIC packages is <code>.BAZ</code>. 
Packages are a convenient choice if a program needs to change many PC-BASIC options 
to function as desired, or if it needs a particular working directory setup.
Packages are unpacked to a temporary directory each time they are loaded.
The temporary directory is removed when PC-BASIC closes and it is therefore 
not possible to save files and re-open them on the next run of the package.</p>


<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>You can print from PC-BASIC programs 
by accessing the <code>LPT1:</code> device. PC-BASIC will send the output to 
your operating system's default printer, unless you change the <code>lpt1=</code>
option. To print through a printer named <code>MyPrinter</code>, set 
<code>lpt1=PRINTER:MyPrinter</code>. You can also attach printers to the 
<code>LPT2:</code> and <code>LPT3:</code> devices.</p>

<p>The output will be sent to the printer when you close PC-BASIC. If you prefer,
you can instead send every page separately to the printer by setting 
<code>print-trigger=page</code>. You can even send every line separately, but 
this only makes sense on a tractor-fed printer (as was common in GW-BASIC's 
heyday).</p>

<p>It's easy to print to a file instead of a printer: set <code>lpt1=FILE:output.txt</code> 
to send all <code>LPT1:</code> printer output to the text file <code>output.txt</code>.

<p>The printing statements <code>LPRINT</code> and <code>LLIST</code> always send 
their output to PC-BASIC's <code>LPT1:</code> device.<p>

<p>The presentation of printed documents is left to your operating system: it 
will be the default presentation of text files. If you wist to change the way 
documents are printed, please refer to your OS's settings. On Windows, for example, text files
are printed by <code>notepad.exe</code> and changing the default settings in that
application will change the way PC-BASIC documents are printed. You will need to set a
printer font that includes the characters you need to print. On Unix systems,
PC-BASIC will use the <code>paps</code> utility if it is available; this will 
automatically select fonts that support the characters you need.</p>

<h2>Accessing serial and parallel ports</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC provides the serial devices <code>COM1:</code> and <code>COM2:</code>.
To make use of these, you need to attach them to a communications port on your 
computer with the <code>com1=</code> or <code>com2=</code> option. To attach to 
the first physical serial port, set <code>com1=PORT:0</code> (or, alternatively, 
<code>com1=PORT:COM1</code> on Windows or <code>com1=PORT:/dev/ttyS0</code> on
Linux). If you do not have a serial port, you can emulate one by sending the
communications over a network socket: set <code>com1=SOCKET:localhost:7000</code>
and all <code>COM1:</code> traffic will be sent through socket <code>7000</code>.</p>

<p>To access a parallel port, attach it to one of <code>LPT1:</code>, <code>LPT2:</code> or <code>LPT3:</code>.
For example, set <code>lpt2=PARPORT:0</code> to attach your computer's first
parallel port to <code>LPT2:</code>.</p>


<h2>Emulation targets</h2>
<p>By default, PC-BASIC emulates GW-BASIC on a system with VGA video capabilities. 
However, it can emulate several other setups, which differ from each other in 
terms of video and audio capacity, fonts, memory size, as well as available BASIC syntax.
The easiest way to set the emulation target is by using a <code>preset</code> option.
For example, run <code>pcbasic --preset=pcjr</code>. 
Other available emulation target presets are:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Preset</th><th>Emulation target</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pcjr</code></td>
<td>IBM PCjr with Cartridge BASIC, including PCjr video and 3-voice sound capabilities and extended BASIC syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tandy</code></td>
<td>Tandy 1000 with GW-BASIC, including Tandy video and 3-voice sound capabilities and extended BASIC syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>olivetti</code></td>
<td>Olivetti M24 or AT&amp;T PC 6300.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>cga</code></td>
<td>IBM or compatible with Color/Graphics Adapter and a composite monitor. This enables composite colorburst emulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ega</code></td>
<td>IBM or compatible with Extended Graphics Adapter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vga</code></td>
<td>IBM or compatible with Video Graphics Array.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>mda</code></td>
<td>IBM or compatible with Monochrome Display Adapter and
green-tinted monochrome monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>hercules</code></td>
<td>IBM compatible with Hercules Graphics Adapter and green-tinted
monochrome monitor.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<em>Presets</em> are groups of options that are defined in the default configuration 
file. You can create your own presets by creating a header in your private configuration 
file with the name of the new preset, followed by the options you want to apply. For example,
if you define:
<pre>[my_preset]
video=vga
syntax=pcjr
</pre>
you can now run <code>pcbasic --preset=my_preset</code> to start an emulation of 
a hypothetical machine with a VGA video card running PCjr Cartridge BASIC.


<h2>International encoding standards</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC supports a large number of legacy codepages that were common at the time GW-BASIC was popular, including double-byte character set codepages used for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. You can select your codepage by using the <code>codepage=</code> option. For example, <code>codepage=936</code> selects the GBK codepage commonly used on the Chinese mainland.
PC-BASIC will load and save all program files as if encoded in the codepage you select.</p>

<p>It is also possible to load and save programs in the nowadays common UTF-8 standard format, by enabling the <code>utf8</code> option. When <code>utf8</code> is enabled, "ASCII" program source will be saved and loaded in standard UTF-8 encoding. Please note that you will still need to select a codepage that provides all the Unicode characters that your program needs.</p>


<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC emulates the distinctive raster fonts of IBM-compatible machines. The ROM
fonts of the original IBM and Tandy adapters (which are in the public 
domain in a number of countries) have been included in PC-BASIC. These provide the most
accuate emulation. However, the font ROMs only included a single code page &ndash;
US-ASCII 437. </p>
<p>To support code pages beyond 437, PC-BASIC defaults to the <b>CPIDOS</b> font used by 
default in FreeDOS and DOSBox. This font is very similar in style to the IBM VGA 
font but has support for many more code pages, in particular Western and Middle 
Eastern alphabets. If CPIDOS does not include the characters you need, PC-BASIC 
tries to find them in <b>UNI-VGA</b>, which is also very similar in style to VGA. 
If that does not suffice, PC-BASIC falls back to <b>GNU UniFont</b> for the 
missing characters. UniFont's Western glyphs are less similar to the VGA font, but
it provides support for the full Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane. For example, all Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean glyphs in PC-BASIC are taken from UniFont.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the choice of font using the <code>font=</code> option.
You can provide a list of fonts, where the last font specified is the 
most preferred one.</p>
<p>PC-BASIC reads fonts in the <code>.hex</code> format introduced by UniFont. It's 
easy to define custom fonts in this format: it can be edited in a regular text editor. 
See the UniFont project for an authoring tool. You can add custom fonts to PC-BASIC by 
instaling them into the <code>font/</code> subdirectory of PC-BASIC's installation
directory.</p>

<h2>Redirecting input and output</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC supports redirecting input and output the GW-BASIC way: output redirected with the <code>output=</code> option will be sent to the screen as well as the specified file, while input redirected with <code>input=</code> is taken only from the specified file. Note that screen output through the <code>SCRN:</code> device and keyboard input through the <code>KYBD:</code> device are not redirected. Files are read and written in the codepage set with PC-BASIC.</p>

<p>Note that it is also possible to use your operating system's facility to redirect console output using the <code><</code> and <code>></code> operators. It's best to set <code>interface=none</code> so that I/O is redirected through the console. This will produce files in UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<h2>Command-line interface</h2>
<p>You can run PC-BASIC as a command-line interface by setting the <code>interface=cli</code> (or <code>-b</code>) option. No window will be opened: you can type BASIC commands straight into your Command Prompt/Terminal. Use the horizontal arrow keys to move on the current line you're editing; use the vertical arrow keys to show screen rows above and below. Copy and
paste are available only if the calling shell provides them. On Windows, <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Break</b></code> will terminate PC-BASIC immediately. You can use <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>C</b></code> to interrupt the program. The end-of-file key combination (<code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>D</b></code> on Unix, <code><b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Z</b></code> on Windows) will exit PC-BASIC.

<p>You can use the command-line interface to run one or a few BASIC commands directly, like so:
<pre>> pcbasic -bqe="?1+1"
 2
>
</pre>
</p>

<p>For scripting purposes, it is also possible to run PC-BAIC without any interface by setting <code>interface=none</code> or <code>-n</code>. If this is set, PC-BASIC will take input from and send output to the console as UTF-8 without further modification. This is useful in combination with redirection and pipes.</p>

<h2>Text-based interface</h2>
<p>There is also a full-screen text interface available: enable it by setting <code>interface=text</code> (or <code>-t</code>). 
the text-based interface is very similar to the default graphical interface, but runs in your Command Prompt or Terminal window. </p>

<p>In the text-based and command-line interfaces, graphics are not available. Attempting to open a graphical screen mode will lead to an <code>Illegal function call</code> error. Furthermore, many <code><b>Ctrl</b></code> and <code><b>Alt</b></code> key combinations are not available.</p>

<p>On Unix systems only, you can get sound in the text and command-line interfaces over the PC speaker if you install the <code>beep</code> utility. If you use Ubuntu, be aware that the PC speaker is switched off by default. You'll need to edit <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code> and comment out the line <code>blacklist pcspkr</code>. Then, <code>apt-get install beep</code> and be sure to wear appropriate ear protection: the default sound volume is <strong>loud</strong>.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC makes some default choices with basic security in mind, but does not sandbox its programs in any meaningful way. BASIC programs have more or less full access to your computer. You should treat them with the same caution as you would shell scripts or binaries. Therefore, do not run a program from the internet that you have not inspected first using <code>LIST</code> or <code>--convert=A</code> on the command line. You wouldn't just download an executable fom the internet and run it either, right?</p>

<h2>Differences with GW-BASIC</h2>

<p>GW-BASIC was a real-mode DOS program, which means that it had full control over an IBM-compatible 8086 computer. It had direct access to all areas of memory and all devices. Some BASIC programs used this fact, by using <code>POKE</code> and <code>OUT</code> statements as well as <code>CALL</code> and <code>USR</code> machine-code subroutines to perform taks for which BASIC did not provide support. PC-BASIC runs on modern machines which may be based on completely different architectures and anyway do not allow applications to directly access
memory ar devices. Therefore, it is not possible to run machine code on PC-BASIC. It you need machine code, you'll need to use full 
CPU emulation such as provided by DOSBox, Bochs or VirtualBox.</p>

<p>PC-BASIC <em>does</em> provide limited support for the <code>POKE</code> and <code>PEEK</code> statements: some of the most commonly accessed regions of memory are emulated and can be read and (sometimes) written. There is read and write support for video memory, font RAM and selected locations of the low memory segment, including the keyboard buffer. Additionally, there is read support for font ROM, variable, array and string memory, <code>FIELD</code> buffers as well as the program code itself. Writing into the program code is disabled by default, but can be enabled with the <code>allow-code-poke</code> option. Use with care. A number of machine ports related to keyboard input and video modes are supported as well.</p> 

<p>The <code>SHELL</code> statement is, by default, disabled; this is to avoid unpleasant surprises. In GW-BASIC under MS-DOS, <code>SHELL</code> opens a DOS prompt or executes commands in it. The command shells of modern operating systems work differently than those of DOS; in particular, it is impossible to retrieve changes in the environment variables, so that many use cases of <code>SHELL</code> simply would not work; for example, changing the current drive on Windows. Moreover, Unix shells have a syntax that is completely different from that of DOS. You can, however, enable <code>SHELL</code> by setting the <code>shell=native</code> option. Use with care.<p>
