            User configuration file. Options in this file take the form of command-line options
            without the preceding <code><b>--</b></code>. One option per line. Options added under the <code>[pcbasic]</code>
            header are loaded by default. Options added under another header will be loaded if the
            <code><b><a href="#--preset">--preset</a></b></code> option group
            of that name is loaded.
        </dd>

        <dd>
            Saved state of the last PC-BASIC session.
            Continue the last session with <code><b><a href="#--resume">--resume</a></b></code>.

    <p>
        There are no environment settings specific to PC-BASIC. However, BASIC
        programs may access the environment through the <code>ENVIRON$</code>
        function and could therefore have their own environment settings.
